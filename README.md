## Version Support

MissileWarsX is currently stable on modern versions of Minecraft (1.13-1.17), while legacy support is still experimental. The end goal is to bring MissileWars to all Minecraft versions, 1.8+.

## Public Test Server

If you want to try out MissileWarsX before hosting your own server, you can play the minigame on a publicly hosted server at `msw.encodeous.ca`. This server currently runs 1.17.1, and will run on the latest versions.

## Hosting your own server

Currently, there are no public builds of MissileWarsX, but you can build it yourself, or wait for an official release.

To get the standard MissileWars experience, simply install the plugin and run the server. Please note that the plugin 
is designed to run on a clean Minecraft server. Make sure there are no other worlds or plugins, 
(unless you like living on the edge, and risk loss of data).

### Server Software

MissileWarsX is designed to run on top of Paper Spigot. Some features may not be available (Missile tracing) if ran without Paper.

The recommended server configuration is stored in the `recommended-config` folder in this repository.
